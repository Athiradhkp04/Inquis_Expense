# Inquis: Expense – Personal Finance Tracker

This project started as something I built in my first year of college — a small Python script that recorded daily expenses in the simplest way possible.  
It stayed unfinished for quite some time until I came across it again recently while going through my old work.  
I decided to rework it properly, more as a personal exercise in applying what I’ve learned since then.

What began as a few lines of code eventually turned into two complete, working versions — one as a desktop application and the other as a web app.  
I also made use of AI tools during this process, mainly to help with refactoring, interface design, and some of the Streamlit components.

 Why I Revisited It

There wasn’t any particular reason beyond curiosity and the thought that it would be nice to see what I could do with it now.
It became a small side project that helped me combine what I had learned over time — from basic scripting to interface design and web development.
The goal wasn’t to make it perfect, just to make it functional, clean, and worth showing as a complete idea.

Key Features

- Persistent expense storage using SQLite

- Smart keyword-based category suggestions

- Simple visual analysis through bar charts

- Works both as a standalone desktop app and as a browser-accessible web app
